Both methods perform type-safe aggregations on a `KeyValueGroupedDataset`, but the fundamental difference is that the first computes a **single aggregation**, while the second computes **multiple different aggregations simultaneously** in a single pass over the data for much greater efficiency.

### ## The Core Principle: Single-Pass Efficiency

The primary reason for having overloaded `agg` methods that accept multiple `TypedColumn` arguments is **performance**.

Imagine you need to calculate three different things for each product category: the average sale price, the total number of sales, and the standard deviation of the prices.

- Using the single `agg()` method repeatedly would force Spark to scan through all the data for each group three separate timesâ€”once for each calculation.
    
- Using the multi-column `agg()` method is like making a single pass through the data. As Spark iterates over the items in each group, it updates all three aggregators at once. This avoids redundant work and is significantly more efficient.
    

It's like a factory assembly line: it's far more efficient to perform all the necessary steps on a product as it moves down the line once, rather than sending it down the entire line three separate times.

### ## Comparison Table

|Feature|`agg(TypedColumn)`<br/>(Single Aggregator)|`agg(TypedColumn, ...)`<br/>(Multiple Aggregators)|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|To compute **one** custom, type-safe aggregation per group.|To compute **two or more** different aggregations per group **simultaneously**.|
|**Efficiency**|Good for a single calculation. Inefficient if called multiple times for different calculations on the same grouped data.|**Excellent**. The most efficient way to compute multiple aggregations, as it processes each group's data only once.|
|**Return Type**|`Dataset<Tuple2<K, U1>>` where `K` is the key and `U1` is the result of the single aggregator.|`Dataset<TupleN<K, U1, U2, ...>>` where `N` is the number of aggregators + 1. For your 8-column example, it's `Dataset<Tuple9<K, U1, ..., U8>>`.|
|**Use Case Example**|Find just the average price for each product category.|Find the average price, total number of sales, and the most expensive item for each product category, all in one go.|

### ## Practical Java Example

Let's use two separate aggregators: one for calculating the average (`MyAverageAggregator` from our previous discussion) and a new one for simply counting the items.

#### 1. Define a Second Aggregator (`CountAggregator`)

Java

```
public class CountAggregator extends Aggregator<Object, Long, Long> {
    @Override
    public Long zero() { return 0L; }

    @Override
    public Long reduce(Long buffer, Object input) { return buffer + 1; }

    @Override
    public Long merge(Long b1, Long b2) { return b1 + b2; }

    @Override
    public Long finish(Long reduction) { return reduction; }

    @Override
    public Encoder<Long> bufferEncoder() { return Encoders.LONG(); }

    @Override
    public Encoder<Long> outputEncoder() { return Encoders.LONG(); }
}
```

#### 2. Apply Both Aggregators at Once

Now, we'll apply both the `MyAverageAggregator` and the `CountAggregator` in a single `.agg()` call.

Java

```
// Assume 'salesDS' is a Dataset<Sale> from a previous example
MyAverageAggregator avgAgg = new MyAverageAggregator();
CountAggregator countAgg = new CountAggregator();

// Group by category and apply both aggregators simultaneously
Dataset<Tuple3<String, Double, Long>> results = salesDS
    .groupByKey(Sale::getCategory, Encoders.STRING())
    .agg(
        avgAgg.toColumn().name("average_price"),
        countAgg.toColumn().name("number_of_sales")
    );

results.show();
// +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
// |         _1|average_price|number_of_sales|
// +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
// |Electronics|       355.95|              150|
// |   Clothing|        45.55|              320|
// +-----------+-------------+-----------------+
```

As you can see, the result is a `Dataset` containing a `Tuple3`. The tuple's elements correspond to the grouping key (`_1`), the result of the first aggregator (`_2`), and the result of the second aggregator (`_3`). This single operation was far more efficient than performing two separate `.agg()` calls.
